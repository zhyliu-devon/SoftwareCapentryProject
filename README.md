# Lazor Solver Project

**Course**: EN.540.635 - Software Carpentry  
**Instructors**: N. Thota, F. Shaikh  
**Due Date**: November 6, 4:30 PM  

## Project Overview

We're making a program to solve levels in the "Lazors" game. It's a mobile game, and we need to write code to solve the levels using the board files provided.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repo**: Clone the repo to your computer.

## Files and Directories

- `README.md`: Info about the project.
- `functions.py': The scripet contains functions
- `classes.py' :The code contains classes
- 'test.py' : The code allows you to test it

## How to Use

1. **Testing**: To test the algorithm with the given examples, use the command:
   ```bash
   python test.py
   ```
2. **Output**: The solution will be saved as a PNG.

## Rules and Constraints

1. **Input Format**: The board should be read from a `.bff` file.
2. **Block Types**: The board can have three types of blocks:
   - Reflect Blocks
   - Opaque Blocks
   - Refract Blocks
3. **Performance**: The solution should be found within 2 minutes.
